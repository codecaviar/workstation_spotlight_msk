# Workstation Spotlight: 3 Smart Strategies to Improve Musculoskeletal Health

## Project Overview

Arthritis Research UK defines musculoskeletal health as follows...

" Musculoskeletal health means more than the absence of a musculoskeletal condition. Good musculoskeletal health means that the muscles, joints and bones work well together without pain. People with good musculoskeletal health can carry out the activities they want to with ease and without discomfort. It is possible to have poor musculoskeletal health without having a specific musculoskeletal condition. "

Arthritis Research UK identifies the wider economic impact...

" Poor musculoskeletal health is a major barrier to workplace participation. People with musculoskeletal conditions are less likely to be employed than people in good health, and more likely to retire early. If employed, people with musculoskeletal conditions are more likely to need time off and have reduced household income compared to those who do not. This lost productivity has an impact on the national economy, as well as affecting the state through the lost of revenue from taxation and increased need for state disability and low-income benefits.
